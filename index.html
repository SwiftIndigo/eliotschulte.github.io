            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check Your Oil Regularly</strong> – Change your oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, depending on your car’s make and model. Fresh oil helps lubricate the engine and prevents overheating.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect Your Tires</strong> – Ensure tires are properly inflated and check tread depth to prevent blowouts. Rotate them every 6,000 miles.</li>
                <li><strong>Replace Air Filters</strong> – Clean air filters help with engine performance and fuel efficiency. Replace them at least once a year or every 12,000 miles.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Fluid Levels</strong> – Regularly check engine coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and transmission fluid to keep all systems running smoothly.</li>
                <li><strong>Brake Inspection</strong> – Listen for any unusual sounds or vibrations when you apply the brakes. Have your brake pads inspected regularly.</li>
                <li><strong>Replace Windshield Wipers</strong> – Replace wipers every 6-12 months to ensure visibility in rainy or snowy conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor Battery Health</strong> – Check your car’s battery for corrosion and ensure it’s holding a charge. Replace it if it’s more than 3-5 years old.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Your Car Clean</strong> – Regularly wash and wax your car to protect the paint. Clean the interior to maintain a comfortable driving environment.</li>
